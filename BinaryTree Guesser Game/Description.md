I'm not going to lie, this was probably the most frustrating one I've done to date

Essentially it's a guessing game that incorporates a binary tree. You traverse the tree in an inorder traversal and once you get to a leaf node(i.e. a guess) if it's incorrect, you could add another branch to the tree.

You could also save any tree you had made into a separate file that could be accessed by the program and loaded in so you wouldn't lose progress on that tree.
Essentially it was possible to create a very comprehensive tree if you were bothered to spend the time on it.
